<p>Iahub likes trees very much. Recently he discovered an interesting tree named
propagating tree. The tree consists of n nodes numbered from 1 to n, each node
i having an initial value ai. The root of the tree is node 1.</p>

<p>This tree has a special property: when a value val is added to a value of node
i, the value -val is added to values of all the children of node i. Note that
when you add value -val to a child of node i, you also add -(-val) to all
children of the child of node i and so on. Look an example explanation to
understand better how it works.</p>

<p>This tree supports two types of queries:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“1 x val” — val is added to the value of node x;</li>
  <li>“2 x” — print the current value of node x.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to help Iahub understand the tree better, you must answer m queries
of the preceding type.</p>

<p><strong>Input</strong></p>

<p>The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200000). The second
line contains n integers a1, a2, …, an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000). Each of the next n–1
lines contains two integers vi and ui (1 ≤ vi, ui ≤ n), meaning that there is
an edge between nodes vi and ui.</p>

<p>Each of the next m lines contains a query in the format described above. It is
guaranteed that the following constraints hold for all queries: 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤
val ≤ 1000.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>

<p>The values of the nodes are [1, 2, 1, 1, 2] at the beginning.</p>

<p>Then value 3 is added to node 2. It propagates and value -3 is added to it’s
sons, node 4 and node 5. Then it cannot propagate any more. So the values of
the nodes are [1, 5, 1, - 2, - 1].</p>

<p>Then value 2 is added to node 1. It propagates and value -2 is added to it’s
sons, node 2 and node 3. From node 2 it propagates again, adding value 2 to
it’s sons, node 4 and node 5. Node 3 has no sons, so it cannot propagate from
there. The values of the nodes are [3, 3, - 1, 0, 1].</p>
