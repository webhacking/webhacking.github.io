<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>JavaScript is a very flexible object-oriented language when it comes to
syntax. In this article you can find three ways of defining and instantiating
an object. Even if you have already picked your favorite way of doing it, it
helps to know some alternatives in order to read other people’s code.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that there are no classes in JavaScript. Functions can
be used to somewhat simulate classes, but in general JavaScript is a class-
less language. Everything is an object. And when it comes to inheritance,
objects inherit from objects, not classes from classes as in the “class”-ical
languages.</p>

<p><strong>1. Using a function</strong></p>

<p>This is probably one of the most common ways. You define a normal JavaScript
function and then create an object by using the new keyword. To define
properties and methods for an object created using function(), you use the
this keyword, as seen in the following example.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>function Apple (type) {    this.type = type;    this.color = "red";    this.getInfo = getAppleInfo;} // anti-pattern! keep reading...function getAppleInfo() {    return this.color + ' ' + this.type + ' apple';}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To instantiate an object using the Apple constructor function, set some
properties and call methods you can do the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var apple = new Apple('macintosh');apple.color = "reddish";alert(apple.getInfo());
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>**<br />
**</p>

<p><strong>1.1. Methods defined internally</strong></p>

<p>In the example above you see that the method getInfo() of the Apple “class”
was defined in a separate function getAppleInfo(). While this works fine, it
has one drawback – you may end up defining a lot of these functions and they
are all in the “global namespece”. This means you may have naming conflicts if
you (or another library you are using) decide to create another function with
the same name. The way to prevent pollution of the global namespace, you can
define your methods within the constructor function, like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>function Apple (type) {    this.type = type;    this.color = "red";    this.getInfo = function() {        return this.color + ' ' + this.type + ' apple';    };}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using this syntax changes nothing in the way you instantiate the object and
use its properties and methods.</p>

<p><strong>1.2. Methods added to the prototype</strong></p>

<p>A drawback of 1.1. is that the method getInfo() is recreated every time you
create a new object. Sometimes that may be what you want, but it’s rare. A
more inexpensive way is to add getInfo() to the prototype of the constructor
function.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>function Apple (type) {    this.type = type;    this.color = "red";} Apple.prototype.getInfo = function() {    return this.color + ' ' + this.type + ' apple';};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, you can use the new objects exactly the same way as in 1. and 1.1.</p>

<p><strong>2. Using object literals</strong></p>

<p>Literals are shorter way to define objects and arrays in JavaScript. _To
create an empty objec_t using you can do:</p>

<p>var o = {};</p>

<p>instead of the “normal” way:</p>

<p>var o = new Object();</p>

<p><em>For arrays</em> you can do:</p>

<p>var a = [];</p>

<p>instead of:</p>

<p>var a = new Array();</p>

<p>So you can skip the class-like stuff and create an instance (object)
immediately. Here’s the same functionality as described in the previous
examples, but using object literal syntax this time:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var apple = {    type: "macintosh",    color: "red",    getInfo: function () {        return this.color + ' ' + this.type + ' apple';    }}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case you don’t need to (and cannot) create an instance of the class,</p>

<p>it already exists. So you simply start using this instance.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>apple.color = "reddish";alert(apple.getInfo());
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Such an object is also sometimes called singleton. In “classical” languages
such as Java, singleton means that you can have only one single instance of
this class at any time, you cannot create more objects of the same class. In
JavaScript (no classes, remember?) this concept makes no sense anymore since
all objects are singletons to begin with.</p>

<p>**<br />
**</p>

<p><strong>3. Singleton using a function</strong></p>

<p>Again with the singleton, eh? :)</p>

<p>The third way presented in this article is a combination of the other two you
already saw. You can use a function to define a singleton object. Here’s the
syntax:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var apple = new function() {    this.type = "macintosh";    this.color = "red";    this.getInfo = function () {        return this.color + ' ' + this.type + ' apple';    };}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So you see that this is very similar to 1.1. discussed above, but the way to
use the object is exactly like in 2.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>apple.color = "reddish";alert(apple.getInfo());
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>new function(){…} does two things at the same time: define a function (an
anonymous constructor function) and invoke it with new. It might look a bit
confusing if you’re not used to it and it’s not too common, but hey, it’s an
option, when you really want a constructor function that you’ll use only once
and there’s no sense of giving it a name.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>You saw three (plus one) ways of creating objects in JavaScript. Remember that
(despite the article’s title) there’s no such thing as a class in JavaScript.
Looking forward to start coding using the new knowledge? Happy JavaScript-ing!</p>
