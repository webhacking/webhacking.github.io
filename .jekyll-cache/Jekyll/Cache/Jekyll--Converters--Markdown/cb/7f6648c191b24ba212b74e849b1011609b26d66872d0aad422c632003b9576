<p>Click [Start] [Run] and type â€œREGSVR32 /i SHELL32â€ then press the Enter key.</p>

<p>Try the below methods and check:</p>

<p><strong>Method 1: Run the SFC.</strong></p>

<p>Follow the below steps:</p>

<p>Open Command Prompt.</p>

<p>Select â€œRun as Administratorâ€.</p>

<p>Type â€œsfc /scannowâ€ without quotes and hit Enter.</p>

<p>Now check for the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Method 2: Run the DISM Tool.</strong></p>

<p>If the issue persists, I would have you run the DISM tool to check the system
health and will try to restore the files.</p>

<p>Click on â€˜Startâ€™.</p>

<p>Enter â€˜Command promptâ€™ in the Search box.</p>

<p>In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command prompt, and then
tap or click â€˜Run as administratorâ€™.</p>

<p>In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands.
Press the Enter key after each command:</p>

<p>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</p>

<p>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</p>

<p>To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, and then press
Enter.</p>

<p>Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not
cancel it.</p>

<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>

<p>I would suggest you to run virus scan to make sure the computer is free from
virus.</p>

<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that
provides on-demand scanning and helps remove virus, spyware, and other
malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</p>
