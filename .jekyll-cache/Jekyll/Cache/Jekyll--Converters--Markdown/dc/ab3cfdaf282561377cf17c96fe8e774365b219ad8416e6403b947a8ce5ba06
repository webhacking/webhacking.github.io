<p>pg_dump is a utility for backing up a PostgreSQL database. It makes consistent
backups even if the database is being used concurrently. pg_dump does not
block other users accessing the database (readers or writers).</p>

<p>pg_dump only dumps a single database. To backup global objects that are common
to all databases in a cluster, such as roles and tablespaces, use pg_dumpall.</p>

<p>Dumps can be output in script or archive file formats. Script dumps are plain-
text files containing the SQL commands required to reconstruct the database to
the state it was in at the time it was saved. To restore from such a script,
feed it to psql. Script files can be used to reconstruct the database even on
other machines and other architectures; with some modifications, even on other
SQL database products.</p>
