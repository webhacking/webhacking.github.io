<p>My guess is that Google probably uses some combination of the following
techniques and ranks the results using a proprietary algorithm.</p>

<p><strong>Feature Detection (Image fingerprinting to look for exact match) &amp; Search by Color &amp; Visual Similarity Search</strong></p>

<p>There are three commonly used feature detection algorithms for matching image
deformation such as blur, rotation, scale, and illumination change.</p>

<p>They are SIFT, PCA-SIFT and SURF</p>

<ul>
  <li>SIFT is slow and not good at illumination changes, while it is invariant to rotation, scale changes and affine transformations.</li>
  <li>SURF is fast and has good performance as the same as SIFT, but it is not stable to rotation and illumination changes.</li>
  <li>PCA-SIFT is the best but it has problems with image blur.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no perfect algorithm, so the choice depends mainly on the
application, and what kind of trade-offs the application can tolerate.</p>
