I"C<p>Style guides for Google-originated open-source projects</p>

<p>Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.</p>

<p>“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This project holds the
style guidelines we use for Google code. If you are modifying a project that
originated at Google, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides
that apply to that project.</p>

<p>Our C++ Style Guide, Objective-C Style Guide, Java Style Guide, Python Style
Guide, Shell Style Guide, HTML/CSS Style Guide, JavaScript Style Guide,
AngularJS Style Guide, Common Lisp Style Guide, and Vimscript Style Guide are
now available. We have also released cpplint, a tool to assist with style
guide compliance, and google-c-style.el, an Emacs settings file for Google
style.</p>

<p>If your project requires that you create a new XML document format, our XML
Document Format Style Guide may be helpful. In addition to actual style rules,
it also contains advice on designing your own vs. adapting an existing format,
on XML instance document formatting, and on elements vs. attributes.</p>
