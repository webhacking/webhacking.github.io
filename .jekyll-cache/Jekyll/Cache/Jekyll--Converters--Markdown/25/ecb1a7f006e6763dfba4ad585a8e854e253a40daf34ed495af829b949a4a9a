<p>So, you want to start building realtime event driven applications using the
new HTML5 WebSocket API?</p>

<p>You want it to work in all browsers, no matter if they have WebSocket support
or not</p>

<p>You don‚Äôt want to rely on proprietary technology such as Flash to provide a
fallback</p>

<p>And naturally, you don‚Äôt want to write more than one implementation</p>

<p>Introducing, the gracefulWebSocket jQuery plugin:</p>

<p>Implements the w3c WebSocket interface</p>

<p>Wraps the native WebSocket if support is detected</p>

<p>Provides a default fallback using traditional AJAX polling over HTTP</p>

<p>Requires no extra code on the frontend, allows you to target the WebSocket API
today and let users take advantage of it as more browsers add support.</p>

<p>Default fallback behavior can be overridden by plugin options</p>
