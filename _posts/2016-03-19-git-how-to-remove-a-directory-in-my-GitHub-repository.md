**Remove directory from git and local**

You could checkout 'master' with both directories;

  

    git rm -r one-of-the-directories git commit -m "Remove duplicated directory" git push origin master

  

**Remove directory from git but NOT local**

As mentioned in the comments, what you usually want to do is remove this
directory from git but not delete it entirely from the filesystem (local)

In that case use:

  

    git rm -r --cached myFolder
