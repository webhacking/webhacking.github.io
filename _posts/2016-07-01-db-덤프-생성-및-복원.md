postgresql은 db 백업/복원으로 pg_dump라는 유틸리티를 제공함

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/app-pgdump.html>

  

pg_dump is a utility for backing up a PostgreSQL database. It makes consistent
backups even if the database is being used concurrently. pg_dump does not
block other users accessing the database (readers or writers).

  

pg_dump only dumps a single database. To backup global objects that are common
to all databases in a cluster, such as roles and tablespaces, use pg_dumpall.

  

Dumps can be output in script or archive file formats. Script dumps are plain-
text files containing the SQL commands required to reconstruct the database to
the state it was in at the time it was saved. To restore from such a script,
feed it to psql. Script files can be used to reconstruct the database even on
other machines and other architectures; with some modifications, even on other
SQL database products.
