## PtrListLen

회사에서 면접 진행하기 앞 서, 면접자에게 문제를 주기 전

먼저 Codility 문제를 풀어보고 난이도를 판단해서 문제를 고르기로하여 간단하게 문제를 풀어보았다.


A pointer is called a linked list if:

  

  * it is an empty pointer (it is then called a terminator or an empty list); or
  * it points to a structure (called a node or the head) that contains a value and a linked list (called the tail).
  * The length of a list is defined as the total number of nodes it contains. In particular, an empty list has length 0.

  

For example, consider the following linked list:

  

A -> B -> C -> D ->

This list contains four nodes: A, B, C and D. Node D is the last node and its
tail is the terminator. The length of this list is 4.

  

Assume that the following declarations are given:


```
class IntList {  var $value = 0;  var $next = NULL;}
```
  

Write a function:

  
```php
function solution($L);
```
  

that, given a non-empty linked list L consisting of N nodes, returns its
length.

  

For example, given list L shown in the example above, the function should
return 4.

  

Assume that:

  

N is an integer within the range [1..5,000];

list L does not have a cycle (each non-empty pointer points to a different
structure).

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will
not be the focus of the assessment.

  

## 작성한 코드

```php
function solution($m)

{

     // var_dump($m);

     $counter = 0;

     while ( $m ) {

         $m = $m->next;

         $counter++;

     }





    //   var_dump($counter);

     return $counter;

}
```
