We have Windows 8 now. I`ve been trying to figure out how to get rid of the
blue box (outline) that shows on everything I click on, and when I type. It`s
so annoying and when I use some applications and games It is in the way. Can
someone please help?

thank you'

  

  

  

@Answer

I also have the exact same problem.

This problem started some time after loading the Window 8.

It is extremely annoying as I see the blue box on the top of the letters as I
type.
